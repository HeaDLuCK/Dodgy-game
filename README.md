<h3 align="center">Dodge Game</h3>
<b>Dodge Game</b> is my first-ever game project. Itâ€™s simple, like when a beginner web developer starts by building a basic HTML structure just to figure out how things work. The game is still in development, but once it's finished, I hope you'll enjoy the concept!

<h3 align="center">About the Game</h3>
In Dodge Game, you control a cube that avoids obstacles. Some obstacles are triggered by your movement and will start chasing you, making the game more challenging.
